There are 9 Python files and 1 LibreOffice Calc document. Those files are discussed in my Presentation talk
at LibreOffice and Open Source Conference 2024, 10 - 12 Oct 2024 in Luxembourg. This event held onsite but 
I present my presentation remotely (https://events.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice-conference-2024/talk/WMJQNY/). 
Unfortunately, due to technical problem my talk was not happened, but you can read slide, source code and Libreoffice Calc file here. Keep Smile :-).
